What's this application about?

It has aimed to simulate a social website such as Instagram.
It has no implementation such as likes or comments, because I followed the KISS(Keep it Simple Stupid) concept.

What vulnerabilities were implemented?
1. Bypassing Client-Side Control - Hidden checkbox
2. Attacking authentication -Pass over CAPTCHA form
3. Injecting Code - SQL Injection

What protection were used?
1. Clean session link
2. Session timeout
3. Using CAPTCHA
